    abstract = {We examine how site-based path planning algorithms for enclosed spaces can be enhanced with situational detail. Addressing this question has led to value propositions in facility design, where there is often a call to match, map, and merge infrastructure considerations and configurations with potential implications for individual, group, and crowd flow through enclosed spaces. Responding to this question also invokes computational propositions, as facility design software is often computationally conservative with few resources devoted to simulation. We show that situational factors—the peculiarities and momentarily fleeting shifts in an individualized context that embody people in their movement through spaces—can be embedded into traditional, computationally lean path planning heuristics in ways that are actionable in widely used facility design software. We achieve this with algorithmic expansion of well-known planning algorithms using node-based architectures that permit the inclusion detail if, when, and where needed in a hyper-localized situational context that nests within site considerations. We demonstrate a proof of concept for use in the popular Unity 3D modeling platform, showing that situationally sensitive path planning can be achieved during the simulation run time of prototypical design scenarios for enclosed spaces with moving individuals, groups, and crowds.},
