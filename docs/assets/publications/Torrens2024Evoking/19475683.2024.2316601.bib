    abstract = { We tackle the issue of how one might close the gap between geographies of people's behavioural experiences and computer models designed to depict those geographies as simulations. We introduce the idea of Immersive Geosimulation Environments (IGEs) as a methodology for coupling spatial behaviour directly to simulation by providing access to (and interaction with) geographic information in ways that elicit user response as fully realized spatial spatial experiences. Importantly, IGEs allow spatial behaviour to be embodied to geosimulation, rather than remaining vicarious to its geography. To examine the utility of IGE methodology, we demonstrate a worked example in the safety science of road-crossing. We present an end-to-end IGE testbed for examining pedestrian - traffic - environment interactions at the roadside. The IGE is designed to achieve congruence between reality and simulation across two related channels. Congruence in fidelity tackles adherence to real-world counterparts, i.e. the condition that IGE elements should function with authenticity to real-world geographies. Congruence in verisimilitude addresses how realistic IGEs seem to the individual user experience, i.e. an IGE's ability to evoke natural spatial behaviour within model scenarios. Our results point to the significance of embodiment in closing the reality gap. We posit that facilitating the formation of action maps, which relate models to users' behaviour, could be key in providing functionally embodied geographic information systems and geosimulation systems. }
